# 🩺 IoT-Based Assistive Care System for Patients and Caregivers

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **hardware and software integrated assistive care system** designed to improve **timely communication between patients and caregivers**, particularly for elderly, dependent, and physically challenged individuals.

Delayed communication in healthcare environments can lead to safety risks, increased caregiver burden, and reduced quality of care. This project addresses these challenges by proposing an **affordable, wireless, and IoT-enabled solution** that enables faster caregiver response and improves patient autonomy.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Timely communication between patients and caregivers is essential for ensuring safety and quality healthcare.
In many home-care and institutional settings, patients lack a simple and reliable way to communicate their needs, leading to delayed assistance and increased risk.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The proposed system is a **low-cost assistive care solution** that combines **hardware interfaces** with **software-based IoT communication**.

### Patient Side (Hardware)

Patients can communicate their needs using:

* LCD display for visual feedback
* Keypad for simple input
* Voice-assisted interaction for ease of use

### Caregiver Side (Software)

Caregivers receive:

* Real-time notifications via an **IoT dashboard**
* SMS alerts for immediate attention

This ensures faster intervention, better monitoring, and improved patient safety.
